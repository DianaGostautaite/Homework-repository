<h2>Preparation method</h2>
<p><h3>Step 1</h3></p>
<p>How to get almond flour:</p>
<ol>
<li>In a store where they sell nuts, you can ask them to grind the nuts into flour (they do this in a coffee grinder).</li>
<li>Sift it</li>
<li>The almonds should be peeled if you are making white macarons.</li>
<li>If making chocolate macarons, you can use regular almonds.</li>
</ol>
<p>How to make flour for macarons:</p>
<ul>
<li> Preheat the oven to 150 degrees.</li>
<li>Mix almond flour, powdered sugar, and cocoa in a food processor for 2 minutes. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper, pour the dry mixture onto the
sheet, and dry it in the oven for 5 minutes. Sift through a very fine sieve.</li>
</ul>

<p><h3>Step 2</h3></p>
<ul>
<li>Whisk the egg whites, gradually adding granulated sugar until shiny. Add the dry mixture to the egg whites and gently mix from top to bottom.</li>
<li>The egg mixture will have a viscous consistency.</li>
</ul>

<p><h3>Step 3</h3></p>
<p>Prepare the ganache.</p>
<ol>
<li>Heat the cream, add the pieces of chocolate.</li>
<li>Let it cool and refrigerate (preferably overnight).</li>
<li> Stir until fully dissolved.</li>
</ol>

<p><h3>Step 4</h3></p>
<ol>
<li> Place the mixture into a pastry bag with a round nozzle and pipe small, evenly sized circles onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.</li>
<li>Leave the baking sheet for 1 hour (I had a crust form in 30 minutes) at room temperature to form a crust.</li>
</ol>
<p><q>This is very important; if the crust does not form, cracks will appear on the surface of the macarons during baking. You can check by touching the
surface with your finger; if it doesn't stick, you can bake it.</q></p>
<p>Bake in a preheated oven for 12 minutes, turning the baking sheet 180° after 6 minutes to ensure even baking.</p>

<p><h3>Step 5</h3></p>
<ul>
<li>Remove the baking sheet from the oven and remove the parchment paper with the cookies.</li>
<li>Sprinkle cold water on the cookies, then return the parchment with the cookies back to the baking sheet.</li>
</ul>

<p><h3>Step 6</h3></p>
<p>Assembly. Squeeze the filling from the pastry bag onto one half of the macaron and cover with the other half.</p>

<p><h2>HOUSEKEEPING TIP</h2></p>
<p><q><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macaron#:~:text=A%20macaron%20(%2Fˌmæ,meal%2C%20and%20often%20food%20colouring.">Macaron (French: Macaron)"</a>— is a French confection made from egg whites, powdered sugar, granulated sugar, ground almonds, and food
coloring. It is usually made in the shape of cookies; cream or jam is placed between two layers. The finished product is soft, with a smooth surface,
and melts in the mouth. Macarons are sold in French McDonald’s; since 2010, these cookies have been known in the USA and Canada; their version
is known in Japan.</q></p>
